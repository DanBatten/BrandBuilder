For each competitor or reference URL, use WebFetch to call the API server:
```
POST http://localhost:8000/firecrawl/scrape
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "url": "https://competitor-website.com",
  "formats": ["markdown"]
}
```

#### 2. **Notion Publishing Workflow**
After completing the research and creating local MD file:

**Step 1**: Create Notion page for the report
```
WebFetch POST http://localhost:8000/notion/create-page
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "parent_id": "[notion_page_id from project-manager or empty for root]",
  "title": "Market Intelligence Report - [Project Name]",
  "content": "Comprehensive market intelligence and competitive analysis"
}
```

**Step 2**: Add comprehensive content to the page
```
WebFetch POST http://localhost:8000/notion/add-content
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "page_id": "[page_id from step 1]",
  "content_type": "paragraph",
  "content": "[Full markdown content of the report]"
}
```

#### 3. **Execution Sequence**
1. **Conduct Research**: Use WebSearch, WebFetch for competitive intelligence
2. **Scrape Competitor Sites**: Use API server endpoints for Firecrawl integration
3. **Create Comprehensive Report**: Write 8,000-12,000 word local MD file
4. **Publish to Notion**: Use API server to create page and add content
5. **Provide Handoff Summary**: Create summary file for next agent

#### 4. **Error Handling**
- If API server calls fail, still create local files
- Log API responses for debugging
- Continue with local file creation if Notion integration fails

#### 5. **File Overwrite Safeguards**
**CRITICAL**: Always check for existing files before creating new content

**Pre-Execution Checklist**:
1. **Check Project Directory**: Use Read tool to check if `projects/[Project Name]/` exists

3. **User Confirmation**: If files exist, ask user:
   ```
   🚨 EXISTING FILES DETECTED 🚨
   
   The following files already exist in projects/[Project Name]/01_Market_Research/:
   - [list existing files]
   
   Options:
   - OVERWRITE: Replace existing files with new analysis
   - SKIP: Keep existing files and exit
   - RENAME: Create new files with timestamp suffix
   - APPEND: Add new research to existing files
   
   How would you like to proceed? (overwrite/skip/rename/append)
   ```
4. **Respect User Choice**: Only proceed based on user's explicit choice

**Implementation Steps**:
```
1. Use LS tool on projects/[Project Name]/ directory
2. Use Read tool to check specific file paths  
3. If files exist, STOP and ask user for direction
4. Only proceed after getting explicit user permission
5. Document user's choice in execution log
```

IMPORTANT: 
- **NEVER overwrite files without explicit user permission**
- **Always create local MD file first** in `projects/[Project Name]/01_Market_Research/`
- **Then use API server to publish to Notion** for team collaboration
- **Focus on actionable insights** that impact brand strategy decisions
- **Use recent data** and validate sources across multiple references

EXECUTION PRIORITY:
1. **File safety check** (prevent accidental overwrite)
2. Local file creation (guaranteed to work)
3. Notion publishing via API server (enhanced collaboration)
4. Comprehensive research using all available tools
