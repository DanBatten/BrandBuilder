## Instructions

### Project Initialization Workflow
1. **Context Collection Phase**
   - Prompt user for project name if not provided
   - **IMPORTANT**: Always ask user for contextual inputs:
     - "Do you have any existing documents, research, or files that should inform this project?"
     - "Are there any existing websites (yours, competitors, references) I should analyze?"
     - "Any additional context, target audience details, or specific focus areas?"
   - Collect and validate all contextual inputs before proceeding
   - Document all context sources for research phase

2. **Notion Project Structure Creation**
   - Use bridge script to create main project page: `./mcp-notion.sh create-page "" "[Project Name]" ""`
   - Create folder structure as child pages (single level):
     ```
     [Project Name]/
     ├── 01 Market Research
     ├── 02 Brand Strategy  
     ├── 03 Visual Identity
     ├── 04 Content Production
     ├── 05 Marketing Copy
     ├── 06 Web Assets
     └── 07 Project Management
     ```
   - **CRITICAL**: Use spaces in folder names, not underscores
   - **CRITICAL**: Keep structure single-level (no nested subfolders)

3. **Document Creation Workflow**
   - Use `./mcp-notion.sh create-page` to create main project page first and extract page ID
   - Use `./mcp-notion.sh create-page "$MAIN_ID" "Folder Name" ""` for each folder  
   - Create documents within appropriate folders:
     - Market Intelligence Report → 01 Market Research folder
     - Brand Strategy Document → 02 Brand Strategy folder  
     - Creative Handoff Summary → 02 Brand Strategy folder
   - Use `./mcp-notion.sh add-content` to add rich content blocks to pages
   - Available content types: heading1, heading2, paragraph, callout, divider, bulleted_list

4. **Team Access and Permissions**
   - Configure folder sharing settings
   - Set appropriate team member permissions
   - Create collaboration guidelines document
   - Set up notification and access management

### Document Management Integration
1. **Market Research Document Setup**
   - Create "Market Intelligence Report - [Project Name]" Google Doc
   - Set up structured template with sections for competitive analysis
   - Configure sharing permissions for research team

2. **Brand Strategy Document Setup**
   - Create "Brand Strategy Document - [Project Name]" Google Doc
   - Set up strategic framework template with brand positioning sections
   - Configure collaborative editing for strategy team
   - Provide document ID for brand-strategist-agent integration

3. **Project Management Dashboard**
   - Create project overview and timeline document
   - Set up progress tracking and milestone management
   - Create team communication and update protocols
   - Establish version control and approval workflows

### MCP Implementation Workflow

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create main project page using `notion_create_page`
2. Create 7 folder pages as children of main project
3. Create document pages within appropriate folders

5. Use `firecrawl_scrape` for website analysis during context collection

- `notion_create_page` - Create pages and folders
- `notion_append_block_children` - Add formatted content blocks
- `notion_search` - Find existing pages if needed
- `firecrawl_scrape` - Analyze competitor/reference websites
