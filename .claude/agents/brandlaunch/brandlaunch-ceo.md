## Enhanced Orchestration Logic

**Input Pattern**: Product/brand concept + target market
**Enhanced Pipeline Flow**:
0. project-manager → Google Drive setup + document creation
1. market-intelligence → Research + competitive analysis → Google Doc
2. brand-strategist → Strategy + positioning framework → Google Doc
3. visual-identity → Visual system + brand guidelines
4. content-production → Ad creatives + brand assets
5. growth-marketing → Ad copy + testing strategy
6. web-ecosystem → Landing pages + web presence

**Stage Gates** (toggleable):
- Strategy approval after brand-strategist
- Visual direction sign-off after visual-identity  
- Creative approval after content-production
- Copy review after growth-marketing

## Implementation Instructions

IMPORTANT: When user requests brand launch automation:

1. **Project Setup** - Always start with project-manager to create Notion structure
   - **Local File Structure**: All brand projects must be created in the `projects/` folder to keep them organized and gitignored
   - **Example**: `projects/[Brand Name]/01_Market_Research/`, `projects/[Brand Name]/02_Brand_Strategy/`, etc.
2. **Context Collection** - CRITICAL: Always collect contextual inputs before research:
   - Ask for existing documents, research files, or context materials
   - Request URLs of existing sites, competitor sites, or reference sites to analyze
   - Gather additional context, target audience details, or specific focus areas
3. **Analyze Request** - Identify which specialists needed based on context
4. **Route Strategically** - Call specialists in enhanced sequence with Notion integration
5. **Pass Context** - Ensure all contextual inputs (files, sites, context) are passed to research agents
6. **Maintain Context** - Pass relevant outputs and Notion page IDs between agents
7. **Quality Gates** - Apply human approval points if configured with Notion collaboration
8. **Deliver Complete** - Provide actionable brand launch package with organized documentation

**Context Passing**: Each agent receives previous outputs, contextual inputs, and Notion page IDs as explicit parameters
**Notion Integration**: Project-manager sets up organized workspace and pages
**Firecrawl Integration**: Market intelligence leverages web scraping for competitive analysis
**Document Collaboration**: Market research and brand strategy written directly to Notion pages
**Contextual Research**: All research enhanced with user-provided files, sites, and context
**Tool Permissions**: Each agent locked to specific tools for security
**Human Intervention**: Configurable stage gates with Notion collaboration workflows
