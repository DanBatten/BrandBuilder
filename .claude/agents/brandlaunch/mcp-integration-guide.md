↓
Brand guidelines and visual system creation
↓
Feeds into content-production-agent for scaled asset production
```

### Technical Implementation Pipeline
```
web-ecosystem-agent + Context7 MCP + Figma MCP
↓
Design-to-code with current best practices
↓
Production-ready landing pages and web presence
```

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Automated Checks
- Brand consistency validation across all MCP-generated assets
- Technical performance verification for web implementations
- Market research accuracy and source validation
- Design system compliance across visual outputs

### Human Stage Gates
- Strategic direction approval after market research
- Creative direction sign-off after visual identity development
- Campaign approval after content production
- Technical review after web ecosystem development

## Performance Optimization

### MCP Usage Patterns
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar MCP calls for efficiency
- **Caching Strategy**: Store frequently accessed research and assets
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect MCP server limitations and quotas
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when MCP services unavailable

### Quality Control
- **Source Verification**: Validate MCP-provided information
- **Brand Compliance**: Ensure all outputs meet brand standards  
- **Technical Standards**: Verify code quality and performance
- **User Testing**: Validate outputs meet user experience requirements

## Testing and Validation Framework

### System Integration Tests
- Full pipeline execution with real brand scenarios
- MCP server connectivity and performance validation
- Cross-agent communication and context passing
- Output quality and consistency verification

### Performance Benchmarks
- Research completion time and comprehensiveness
- Visual asset creation speed and quality
- Web implementation delivery timeframes
- Overall system orchestration efficiency

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common MCP Issues
- **Authentication Failures**: Check API keys and permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement backoff strategies and caching
- **Service Unavailability**: Fallback to manual processes with alerts
- **Quality Issues**: Implement validation checks and human review gates

### System Recovery Procedures
- Manual fallback workflows for each agent
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- Progressive degradation strategies
- User notification and alternative process communication

## Success Metrics
